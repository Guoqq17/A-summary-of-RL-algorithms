# A summary of RL algorithms
In this repo, I will summarize and implement some key algorithms in RL. This serves as a self-learning notes on my way to RL.

## Deep Q-Learning

This section follows the flow of the paper: [Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Hessel et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf), which gives a good summary of Deep Q-learning algorithms as well as test different combinations of those algorithms.

Let's start from the very beginning, [Mnih et al. (2015)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-data/assets/papers/DeepMindNature14236Paper.pdf) proposed the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm in Nature. This will be used as the baseline of this section.
