# A summary of RL algorithms
In this repo, I will summarize and implement some key algorithms in RL. This serves as a self-learning notes on my way to RL.

## Deep Q-Learning
Let's start from the very beginning, [Mnih et al. (2015)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-data/assets/papers/DeepMindNature14236Paper.pdf) proposed the Deep Q learning algorithm in Nature. This will be used as the baseline of this section.
